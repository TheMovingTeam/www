# {{ title }}

Move was started as a solo project by FatDawlf out of a frustration with their local bus app being annoyingly slow to open and clunky to use.

The idea to make a replacement quickly evolved into the universal app we aim to build now.

## Mission

The mission of Move is to make using public transit as straightforward and easy as possible.
To create a simple and unified experience instead of fiddling with multiple apps. 

## Vision

Bringing a consistent experience to all services will empower people to choose public transit over cars, reducing the usage of cars and carbon emissions.

Move aims to make a better future by removing the friction to acquire the good habits our planet needs.

## Values

Move follows values to steer our work.

This article describes how your data may be collected, stored used, and/or shared ("processed") when using Move ("the application", "the app", etc.) or any services from the Move Team ("we", "us", etc.).

## TL;DR

> 1. Your data is stored primarily on your device.
> 2. Your data is not shared to any third party.
> 3. Time estimate providers within the app may log your anonymized traffic for telemetry purposes. This is not controlled by Move.

## 1. What information is collected?
Move in itself works almost entirely locally, user data is saved locally and any external information is downloaded and kept locally.

We however reserve the right to utilize the following information when provided by you:

> - Email addresses
> - Location information
> - Usage information

## 2. How is your information processed?

This information would be used in the following ways:

> - Email and other contact information may be used to add the user to mailing lists, newsletter, or beta testing queues
> - Additional context provided upon reporting issues with the application's functionality to provide support and bugfixes
> - Some of the transit providers supported by the app may log anonymized traffic telemetry of their servers outside of Move's control.

## 3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

> - **Consent**. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.
> - **Performance of a Contract**. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
> - **Legitimate Interests**. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to: 
>    - Analyze how the app is used so we can improve its functionality
>    - Support our marketing activities
>    - Diagnose problems in the application
> - **Legal Obligations**. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
> - **Vital Interests**. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

In legal terms, we are generally the “data controller” under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform.

This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a “data processor” on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the “data controller” responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions.

If you want to know more about our customers’ privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.

## 4. When and with whom do we share your personal information

We do not share your data to any third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents ("third parties") under any circumstances.

We, however, reserve the right to share some of your personal information in the future for the following situation:

> - **When we use Google Maps Platform APIs**. We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). To find out more about Google’s Privacy Policy, please refer to this [link](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We use certain Google Maps Platform APIs to retrieve certain information when you make location-specific requests. This includes your current location and other similar information.

 ## 5. What is our stance on third party websites

The app may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications.

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us.

We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

## 6. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

We do not currently use cookies or any similar tracking technologies to access or stored information.

## 7. Is your information transferred internationally?

We are based in Spain, if you are submitting the information mentioned in section 2 from outside the country, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities.

If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.

## 8. How long do we keep your information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 9. How do we keep your information safe?

We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## 10. Do we make updates to this policy?

We may update this privacy policy from time to time, indicated by an updated date at the top of this page and will be effective as soon as it's available.

We may notify you about future changes by prominently posting any changes or by sending you a notification.

## 11. How can you contact us about this notice or request a deletion

If you have any questions or want to request a deletion of part or the entirety of your data provided to us, you may do so in the following ways:

> - Our social media channels
> - Contacting our lead developer through [this email address](mailto:support@movetransit.app)

After months of work, it is finally time to announce Move's first Open Beta.

<!-- excerpt -->

Move has been in development for a few months, released in a closed beta state for my friends and family to iron out most issues regarding the core functionality of the app.

Since then I've moved on to support 14 different services across 9 different regions and it's quickly approaching the threshold of an Open Beta in Spain as more and more services are being added over time.

## What Does An "Open Beta" Mean?

An Open Beta is a version of an app that's available to the public but still marked as not fully stable.

This is due to the still rather active development the app is undergoing, getting progressively more integrated with Android's features and expanding to more providers.

## When Will It Be Available?

I hope that move becomes available in early 2026, by the end of January or start of February to be specific.

However, timelines can shift in unpredictable ways, so the exact date isn't entirely clear.

In the meantime, you may sign for the wait-list to be notified when it's finally available, as well as for news in its development.

It won't spam your inbox, only updates will be shared.

## Why?

I'm a fairly regular public transit user, and I've always advocated for people to make greater use of these services.

However, I was personally unsatisfied with the state of public transit apps. The one for my local bus service had quite a rough set of updates that absolutely ruined the experience for me and many other Android users.

That, as well as a motivation to learn Android development, lead me to start Move, to build a better way to access the public transit services right for this decade of tech.

## Sustainable Development

Admittedly and, as much as I would like to, I cannot work on this forever
without earning anything from it to sustainably maintain and continue expanding
the app's capabilities.

I've shuffled a few ways of monetizing, and decided that:

> - I don't like paywalling features
> - I don't like invasive ads
> - I despise subscription services

This has lead me to settle that, at least for now, a Patreon is the best option
to sustain the development and growth of Move, while keeping it free and
available for everyone.

It would mean the world if you signed up for it here, for allowing Move to reach
its goal of becoming the ultimate universal transit app.
